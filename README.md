# ICEAGE
###What's the game about

In order the satisfy your primal needs as a prehistoric squirrel, you need to collect acorns. A lot of em. Roam around your territory, scanning the area with your not-so-prehistoric-high-tech-mobile-device. If a predefined image matches what your camera sees, an acorn will appear on your screen. You will be given the option to collect this **nut**ritious object. If you do so (and you should!) you have a second option: placing a trap. This however costs you an acorn. When someone else tries to take this acorn, they will lose time and (up to) two acorns. These will be transferred to you!

###How to set up the game:

- Download the folder "app/game".
- This folder contains Server.java, MsgClient.java, MsgServer.java and IceAge.apk.
- Compile the Server.
```sh
$ javac Server.java
```
- Install the apk on your android device (make sure your device allows unsigned apps)
- Make sure the pc that runs the server is connected to "kuleuven-guest" (no login required) and the players to "eduroam". If you play this elsewhere, pc and players should be connected to the same network.
- Run the server.
```sh
$ java Server
```
- The server should output its ip address.
- Open the app on your device and press play
- Fill in your username, teamname and the ip of the server (even though it might not look like it, the address itself is editable!).
- Start playing and enjoy!

> Note: The trackers (images) loaded into this app are pictures taken on the ground floor of the building 200A at the KULeuven campus (Heverlee). If you wish to load your own trackers, so you can play it elsewhere, just send a mail to tijs.delvaux@gmail.com and I will try to provide you with more detailed instructions.

###How to start

We recommend at least four players, but you can play it on your own as well.

Divide the players into teams, making sure you input the exact same teamname.

[START PLAYING!]

The Server prints out up-to-date highscores when playing the game as well as confirmations of connection to the server.

When the camera is ready you can start your hunt for acorns.

When you swipe the screen from the left edge to the right, a menu appears with most of the information you will need.
